Thanks to Andrii Tykhonov(https://github.com/tihonav/cad-to-geant4-converter) for providing STL samples
and to the writer of persistency/gdml/G01 example progream.

The main code is written in STPParser.hh and STLParser.cc file.
If you want implement into your project, please refer to this code.

This example demonstrates the usage of the STL reader and writer. It allows
to export geometry descriptions in an application independent format (STL,
stereolithography).
The STL files can be then used to interchange geometries between different
applications and users.
As most of 3D cad programs support exporting as STL in ascii format
you can export your 3D model as STL file and convert into G4TessellatedSolid instance using STLParser class.

Several simple STL files are provided as stl file(https://github.com/tihonav/cad-to-geant4-converter) thanks to .
scii STL files have to follow standard format such as
------------------------------------------------------------------------
facet normal ni nj nk
    outer loop
        vertex v1x v1y v1z
        vertex v2x v2y v2z
        vertex v3x v3y v3z
    endloop
endfacet
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO BUILD THE EXAMPLE ?

- Compile and link to generate the executable (in your CMAKE build directory):
 	      % make

- Execute the application.
  o For reading and visualize interactively a ascii stl file:
 	      % load_stl [stl-file-in].stl [unit mm, m, cm]
